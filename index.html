								<p>I grew up in the Northwoods of Wisconsin which influenced my career path from an early age. Following my mom around to her WI DNR field events and conferences, I gleaned bits and pieces of what it is like to work in the natural resources field. In my Junior year of high school, I attended Conserve School on scholarship. It was a unique opportunity in the form of a semester-long environmental focused preparatory school that provided a twist on a standard high school curriculum. Instead of basic history, we delved into the history of wilderness exploration. Instead of PE, we learned outdoor skills like maple syruping and rock climbing. We also took an AP Environmental Science course that gave us a bit of a head start before going into college. The culmination of the semester-long experience was a backpacking trip at the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. Passing through Marquette on the way to our drop off point and recalling the Northern Michigan University representative’s praise for the school, I knew at that point I wanted to go there.</p>
								<p>A year later after I had been accepted to NMU, I was backpacking on Isle Royale and bumped into the NMU Freshman Fellowship program coordinator. She urged me to apply to get a chance to do a research project with a professor early on in my time at NMU. I didn’t know it at the time but this opportunity was what initially motivated me to involve research in my career. 
									I’ve always wanted seasonal employment in my felavent fields, so I’ve dabbled around working on an organic farm and as a drone pilot ground truthing stream crossings. The lockdowns during the pandemic limited the hiring situation forcing me to look elsewhere rather than returning to be a drone pilot. After going down a rabbit hole of seasonal positions I found a research assistant position through the UW Madison Center for Limnology Trout Lake field station. For a more in depth summary of my experience working as a wild rice phenology research assistant check the next tab. In between the school year off from the field season, I started an internship with the nature conservancy working in one of their departments mapping and coding (see TNC tab). 
									Naturally, I felt that the next step in my career path was to start a masters program. It came down to quite a bit of finagling and a debate between two GRA offers. Finally, I chose to work with Dr. Andrew Tanentzap and Dr. Erik Emilson at Trent University. I go more in depth on this in the Aquatic Carbon Flux tab. 
									</p>
								<p>Currently, my goals are to succeed in my M.Sc. program, learn more about mapping rasters in QGIS, and python.</p>

							<article id="wr_projects">
								<h2 class="major">Wild Rice Projects</h2>
								<p>For two summers, I was a research assistant on a wild rice phenology project with Susan Knight and Gretchen Gerrish. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/wr4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Quite a few people have asked me if I was searching for a job specifically dealing with wild rice because I did multiple college course presentations on it, was interviewed on my 2020 harvest experience, and have been harvesting it with my family since before I can remember. This was not the case and an absolute coincidence. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/wr3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>During the first year I presented at two family events, one of which was Superior Days in Marquette, MI, and the second was The Trout Lake Station (TLS) Open House. In the second year I presented at the TLS Open house again, was the keynotes speaker at an Irving-Ballard-White Birch Lakes Association meeting, and hosted a booth at the Lac Du Flambeau Summer Days event.</p>
								<p>Over the course of the two years a few talented science communicators helped share this research in the news, over the radio, and in blogs.</p>

								<h2 class="major">TNC Projects</h2>
								<p>During the last year of my undergraduate experience, I was searching for a course that combined a wealth of information as well as on the ground experience. 
									I didn’t find any offered course at NMU so my advisor, Dr. Matt VanGrinsven, suggested I look into doing an internship for credit and mentioned the zany legend of a man, 
									Randy Swaty. This internship working with The Nature Conservancy offered project flexibility in their <a href="https://landfire.gov/">LANDFIRE</a> program accompanied by a lab group experience unconventionally
									 not affiliated with a professor at a university.</p>
								<p>The culmination of my undergraduate experience was presenting a poster at the <a href="https://ematula3.github.io/VTFdash/webhost.html#background">IALE - North America conference</a> in March 2022.
									To break the monotony of virtual conferences, I decided to create my poster in an unconventional format. Instead of one faceted slide, I made an R Markdown Flexdashboard to showcase my project 
									exploring new methods in forestry GIS. You're welcome to browse through my <a href="https://ematula3.github.io/VTFdash/webhost.html#background">poster</a> at your leisure.
